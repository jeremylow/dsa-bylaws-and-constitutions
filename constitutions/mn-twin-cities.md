# Constitution and Bylaws of the Twin Cities Local of Democratic Socialists of America

**CONSTITUTION**
---
**Article I. NAME, LEGAL STATUS, TERRITORY**
---
  **Section 1. Name** The name of this organization is the Twin Cities Local of Democratic Socialists of America, hereinafter referred to as TCDSA or the Local.

**Section 2. Legal Status** This organization is recognized as a legal subsidiary of Democratic Socialists of America, a non-profit corporation registered in the state of New York, hereinafter referred to as DSA or the National. TCDSA shall be and remain registered as required by the State of Minnesota and these documents are to be filed with the Secretary of State, if so required.

 **Section 3. Territory** 
 The territory covered by the Local is the sixteen county metropolitan area defined by the US Office of Management and Budget. This metropolitan area includes 14 Minnesota counties and 2 Wisconsin counties. See Addendum 1.

**Article II. PURPOSE**
---
The purpose of this organization is to organize, direct, and facilitate political education and advocacy of issues for members of DSA who reside within the territory defined in Art. I, Sec. 3, and DSA members-at-large throughout Minnesota who choose to join the Local. It is further the purpose of this local to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the local chapter, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA.

We are Socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, sex or any other factor, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are Democratic Socialists because we believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few.

But if the member does not attend that meeting, a vote will be taken and if the vote passes with a simple majority, a vacancy exists.

Branches and sections may not have separate treasuries or funds, but instead must have an accounting line in the TCDSA treasury and budget. All officers and leaders of the branches and sections must be elected democratically, including the representative on the Steering Committee. If a branch or section ceases to meet or act for a period of six (6) months, or if it has been acting in a way to bring disrepute or harm to TCDSA or the National DSA, the Steering Committee may vote in a Steering Committee meeting to dissolve said branch or section. The representatives of the branch or section must be notified at least seven (7) days before this meeting in the usual manner, and they may attend the meeting to defend against dissolution. Once a branch or section is dissolved, it may appeal the dissolution at the next membership meeting. After final dissolution of a branch or section, any property and records must be turned over to the TCDSA Steering Committee.

Item VI SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE ASSETS
---
**Section 1. Definitions and purpose**
a.  Social media is defined as all platforms on the internet that allow for exchange of information between registered accounts.

b.  Membership or association with TCDSA does not confer on any individual member the right to control or dictate or censor online content.

**Section 3. Adjunctive to legal notice requirements**
Use of social media accounts and online assets are not a replacement for legal notice requirements as set out in these bylaws. The Operations Coordinator, on behalf of the Steering Committee, shall use social media accounts and online assets to publicize membership meetings and program meetings and actions and events of TCDSA.

**Section 1. Amendments**
a.  These bylaws may be amended by the TCDSA membership at any legally held membership meeting, including the Annual Convention.

It may be discussed and debated in the meeting where proposed, at the discretion of the chair.

**Section 2. Supermajority rule for passing amendments**
A two-thirds supermajority of the votes cast is required for amendments to pass. The membership shall be notified of the amendment and a new copy of the Constitution and Bylaws shall be posted on the TCDSA website whenever an amendment is made.

Item VIII. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
---
**Section 1. Rules and Construction of Language**
In any business meeting conducted by TCDSA, where neither these bylaws nor the DSA National bylaws dictate parliamentary procedure, Robert’s Rules of Order (most current edition) will be the prevailing rules of procedure. If there is any conflict between these bylaws and Minnesota state law governing nonprofit organizations, Minnesota law will prevail.

**Section 2. Fiscal Year and Accounting**
The fiscal year for TCDSA shall run from October 1 to September 30. In producing financial reports and budgets, TCDSA shall use accounting principles generally accepted for small nonprofit organizations.

**Section 3. External Relationships and Electoral Work**
a.  TCDSA will work in community with organizations that share, at least in part, our vision and principles. This can include socialist or communist organizations under the discipline of democratic centralism, or liberal advocacy organizations that we may disagree with on other issues. Such associations must be understood to be free and mutual on both sides and not to create any obligations or restrictions.
    
b.  In electoral work, it is important to stress to associated groups that TCDSA, like its parent organization, is not a political party. If TCDSA gives an endorsement to a cause or candidate, it must be understood to be informal and informational only.

**Section 4. Prohibited Activity** 
TCDSA shall not engage in activity prohibited by the IRS guidelines established for 501(c)4 organizations or similar rules established by the state of Minnesota. Nor shall TCDSA engage in any activity prohibited by resolutions adopted by DSA’s National Convention or DSA’s National Political Committee.

**Section 5 Accessibility and Class Consciousness**
TCDSA shall strive to make all of its meetings, forums, and actions accessible and safe spaces for all. This consideration will extend to such things as the accessibility and safety of the venue, the type of food offered, accommodations for differences in sight, hearing, mobility and stamina, child care offerings, the avoidance of high cost venues that will essentially exclude some members, and religious and other identity considerations. Socialism is historically built on class consciousness, specifically on lifting up the working class. TCDSA will take care not to subtly exclude or censor working class viewpoints or viewpoints of any traditionally dis-empowered group.

**Section 6. Conflicts of Interest** 
If any action taken by the Steering Committee or TCDSA under the governance of the Steering Committee may potentially benefit materially a member of the Steering Committee, that member is said to have a conflict of interest, and will recuse themselves from voting on that action.

**Section 7. Arbitration or Mediation** 
If a conflict should arise within TCDSA between any member or entity and another member or entity that threatens to harm TCDSA or prevent it from accomplishing its aims, the Steering Committee is empowered to first attempt mediation between the parties. If the Steering Committee itself is one of the entities involved, or if it fails to mediate the conflict, it shall seek the services of an independent mediator to resolve the conflict.

**Section 8. Ratification of this Constitution and these bylaws**
This Constitution and these Bylaws shall be submitted to the membership for ratification at the first Annual Membership Convention of TCDSA to be held in September, 2016.
