Adopted 11/18/17


## ARTICLE I. Name.

South Jersey Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America

The name of the Local Chapter will be the South Jersey Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). DSA is a not-for-profit corporation.


## ARTICLE II. Purpose.

The South Jersey Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (SJDSA) seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and socially controlled.

DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, gender or sexual orientation, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources, production, and economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations -- recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic Left. In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society. This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.

South Jersey Democratic Socialists of America establishes the following as its primary goals and objectives:

(a) Provide a means by which members and supporters of Democratic Socialists of America can participate in their organization;

(b) Openly educate and advocate for democratic socialism in our geographic area;

(c) Actively engage in progressive movements and struggles in South Jersey which are consistent with our values and vision for a democratic, egalitarian, and humane society free from repression and exploitation,

(d) Support other DSA locals and organizing committees in New Jersey and surrounding areas, to the greatest extent possible;

(e) Participate in the national campaigns and projects of the national DSA,

(f) Acknowledge that solidarity with the demands of workers and those who labor is central to improving the daily life of individuals from every gender, race, and nationality.

DSA is proud of the diversity, commitment to democracy, and pluralism which is at the heart of our organization. Core to our purpose is supporting the struggles against racism, sexism, and ableism, as well as affirming feminism, transgender equality, and other positive identity movements.

We are not a political party, nor do we have a “party line,” but we shall endorse and support local electoral candidates, with the consent of Membership, who are aligned with our stated purposes and goals.

SJDSA is united by our belief that capitalism is detrimental to a genuinely free and dignified life. It is destructive to our health and wellbeing, and we demand measures to protect and sustain our environment.

We believe socialism represents the true realization of democracy and strive to ensure the right of all people to express their views in an atmosphere that promotes tolerance and participation.


## ARTICLE III. Membership.

### Section 1. Membership.

Members of the South Jersey Local Chapter of DSA will be those individuals whose dues to national DSA are paid in full, who reside and/or work in the South Jersey area.
