# New Orleans Democratic Socialists of America Chapter Bylaws

Amended and Ratified by the General Membership 10/9/2017

Amended by the General Membership: 12/4/2017, 6/18/2018


## Preamble

All working people, simply because they work, are responsible for the reproduction and persistence of our societies, economies, and cultures.

However, working people are not guaranteed access to the direction and planning of society, be it on matters of public investment, environmental destruction, or imperialist wars.

Therefore, all workers, through all forms of labor, irrespective of nationality, have a class interest in expanding their democratic rights in society.

But, workers and capitalists are in an irreconcilable struggle over political-economic enfranchisement.

Democratic Socialists aim to transform this situation by expanding working-class influence in Southeast Louisiana and society as a whole through the support and creation of genuine working-class institutions that foster values of equality, justice, and peace.

Through these methods, we aim to reorganize society where all people have natural, political, and economic rights, for the purpose of uniting humanity under principles of peace, love, solidarity and  prosperity, in harmony with the ecosystems upon which we depend.
