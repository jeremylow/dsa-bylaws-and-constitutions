### Section 1 Annual Member Convention

TCDSA shall hold a Convention/Meeting for all Members annually in the month of September. This meeting shall elect officers, adopt an annual budget, and set program priorities through motions and resolutions for the coming Fiscal Year. Amendments to these Bylaws may be considered at the Annual Convention.

### Section 2 Notice requirement for Annual Member Convention

Notice of the meeting and a draft agenda shall be delivered either by mail or electronically or both to all members no more than seventeen (17) and no fewer than ten (10) days before the meeting. All members for whom a mailing address is available shall receive the mailed notice, and members who “opt in” for email will receive email notice. The Social Secretary is responsible for this notice, and also for posting notice on Social Media as described in Item V below.

### Section 3 Regular Membership Meetings

TCDSA shall hold at least three additional membership meetings, the time and place of which shall be determined by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee shall set the agenda for the membership meeting, based on input from the members if any. Amendments to these bylaws may be considered at a Membership Meeting.

### Section 4 Notice requirement for Regular Membership Meetings

Notice of each meeting and a draft agenda shall be delivered, either by mail or electronically or both, to all members no more than seventeen (17) and no fewer than ten (10) days before the meeting. All members will receive such notice by electronic mail by default, unless the Social Secretary receives either an in-writing (either via paper, mail, or electronically) request for such notices by United Stats Postal Service mail OR the Social Secretary does not have any electronic mail address on file for the member. The Social Secretary is responsible for this notice, and also for posting the notice on the Official TCDSA Website (twincitiesdsa.org) and on Social Media as described in Item V below.

### Section 5 Emergency Meetings

The Steering Committee may call emergency meetings of the membership with five days’ notice in cases of extreme urgency. Except for the shorter notice, these meetings will be called and conducted in the same way as regular meetings.

### Section 6 Quorum

For any membership meeting, including the annual convention, a quorum is constituted by 10% of the number of members on the membership list maintained by the Social Secretary. DSA at-large members in Minnesota shall not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum or if a quorum exists unless they have asked to be put on the TCDSA member list. The Social Secretary shall compute the number that constitutes a quorum before the meeting. The calculation will be rounded UP to the next whole number. If any non-member chooses to join DSA at the meeting, the Social Secretary will calculate if the new member affects the quorum number. Before the first vote of any meeting can be taken, the Social Secretary must declare whether or not a quorum exists.

### Section 7 Program Meetings

TCDSA will hold at least four (4) program meetings annually. These will be in addition to membership meetings, and business will not be conducted at these meetings. Program meetings can be simple social gatherings, public forums, strategy meetings for the purposes of advocacy actions, teach-ins, book clubs, or movie viewings for the purpose of political education, or any other type of program the members want. Program meetings can be hosted by Branches or Sections, by allied external groups, by Members, or by the Political Education Coordinator. In the absence of anyone else wishing to host a viable program meeting, it shall be the responsibility of the Political Education Coordinator to plan, schedule and host them. Notice requirement is not as stringent for program meetings, but hosts and planners should coordinate with the Social Secretary to maximize participation.


## Item II OFFICERS OF TCDSA

### Section 1 Definition

b) The Social Secretary will be re-elected in even years.

### Section 5 Treasurer

### Section 2 Functions, Powers, Duties

All actions of the Steering Committee must be disclosed to the members at the next membership meeting, and are subject to ratification or amendment by members, if any members should make a motion to do so.

### Section 3 Meetings of the Steering Committee

The Steering Committee shall meet at least monthly. Each fiscal year, the co-chairs and the social secretary shall publish, both by mailed document and electronically, a calendar of the year’s Steering Committee meetings. All members of the Steering Committee must be given written or electronic or verbal notice of any meeting date or time or venue change, and of any additional meetings not on the calendar, at least seven (7) days before the meeting. Meetings of the Steering Committee will be open to members who are not officers, but they can speak only at the discretion of the chair, and are not entitled to notice of the meetings.

### Section 4 Quorum

Attendance of 50% of the Steering Committee members comprises a quorum and is needed to do business. If the Steering Committee holds an odd number of members, the number will be rounded UP for calculating a quorum.

### Section 5 Vacancies

a) If a member of the Steering Committee misses three (3) consecutive meetings, the Steering Committee will cause notice to be sent to that member, either by mail or electronically, that the Steering Committee intends to declare their position vacant and replacethem. The notice must include the date, time and place of the Steering Committee meeting at which the committee will vote on declaring the position vacant. If the member attends that meeting and expresses a desire to remain in the position, no vote will be taken and no vacancy will exist. But if the person does not attend that meeting, a vote will be taken and if the vote passes, a vacancy exists.

b) Vacancies may be created if an officer or branch or section representative loses status as a Member, or resigns from the office, or is removed by the rule in Sec. 5a.

c) If the vacancy created is of an officer, the co-chairs may at their discretion appoint an acting successor, and then a special election will be held at the next usual membership meeting, or a special membership meeting may be called to elect someone to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy is a branch or section representative, it will be up to the branch or section to replace them as soon as they can, by whatever democratic means they choose.


## Item IV DELEGATES TO DSA NATIONAL CONVENTIONS

### Section 1 Nomination and election of delegates

TCDSA shall hold an election for delegates to each National Convention called by DSA. If a Youth Section exists within the territory of TCDSA, the Youth Section will also elect delegates to any YDS Conventions. Nominations will be made in the same manner as nominations for officers. Voting will take place at a Regular Membership meeting. Elections for the National Convention delegation shall be held on the schedule announced by the national organization.


## Item V BRANCHES, SECTIONS AND COMMITTEES

### Section 1 Definitions; how formed

a) A branch or section may be created by any group of at least five (5) Members who have something in common and wish to form a branch or section. Except for the Youth Section, which is defined as a section nationally, the group can choose whether it wants to be called a branch or a section. Branches and sections can be based on geographic area (including a political unit), a common identity, a common interest, or a common institution (such as a labor union or advocacy group or even a political party.)

b. A Committee may be formed by the Steering Committee or it may be formed by any group of at least three (3) Members in order to work on a project or action together.

### Section 2 Branches and Sections; structures; rules; dissolution

Branches and sections shall be primarily autonomous, as long as they act in conformance with the DSA Constitution and Bylaws and these Bylaws. Branches and sections may not have separate treasuries or funds, but instead must have an accounting line in the TCDSA treasury and budget. All officers and leaders of the branches and sections must be elected democratically, including the representative on the Steering Committee. If a branch or section ceases to meet or act for a period of six (6) months, or if it has been acting in a way to bring disrepute or harm to TCDSA or the National DSA, the Steering Committee may vote in a Steering Committee meeting to dissolve said branch or section. The representatives of the branch or section must be notified at least seven (7) days before this meeting in the usual manner, and they may attend the meeting to defend against dissolution. Once a branch or section is dissolved, it may appeal thedissolution at the next membership meeting. After final dissolution of a branch or section, any property and records must be turned over to the TCDSA Steering Committee.

### Section 3 Committees

Committees exist for the purpose of accomplishing work on a project or action. The length of time the committee exists may be determined by its need; it is possible for a committee to be ongoing, or purely ad hoc. At their discretion, the Steering Committee may appoint a committee representative to the Steering Committee. Committees shall report on their activities to the Steering Committee on a time basis to be determined by the Steering Committee, which will in turn report committee actions to the membership at membership meetings or by other means.


## Item VI SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE ASSETS

### Section 1 Definitions and purpose

Social media is defined as all current platforms on the internet that allow for exchange of information between registered “accounts.” Online assets refers to organizational email accounts, websites, and opt-in mass email platforms, and other similar tools for using the internet, whether paid-for or free, that the TCDSA may “own.” Social media accounts and online assets such as websites and opt-in email newsletters allow TCDSA and other organizations to communicate with their members in new and often better ways than the traditional methods of postcards, flyers, and phone trees. TCDSA embraces the use of new media to further its organizing and advocacy.

### Section 2 Ownership and control

Social media accounts and online assets set up in the name of TCDSA are the virtual property of TCDSA and as such, the content of these assets will be under the control of the TCDSA Steering Committee or its delegates. The co-chairs, the recording secretary, the social secretary and at least one other officer will hold the keys and passwords to all social media and online assets as a security measure. Membership or association with TCDSA does not confer on any individual member the right to control or dictate or censor online content. Officers of TCDSA will self-educate about libel laws, best practices, security and privacy considerations in order to responsibly control on-line content.

### Section 3 Adjunctive to legal notice requirements

Use of social media accounts and on-line assets are not a replacement for legal notice requirements as set out in these bylaws. The Social Secretary, on behalf of the Steering Committee, shall use social media accounts and on- line assets to publicize membership meetings and program meetings and actions and events of TCDSA.


## Item VII AMENDMENTS TO BYLAWS

### Section 1 Amendments

These bylaws may be amended by the membership at any legally held membership meeting, including the annual convention. The amendment may be brought to the meeting in one of two ways. a. The Steering Committee may propose the amendment, to be voted up or down at the next membership meeting. The text of the amendment and the intent tovote on it will form part of the notice requirement for the meeting. b. A Member may move to amend the constitution or bylaws at a membership meeting, in which case it will be voted on in the next membership meeting. It may be discussed and debated in the meeting where proposed, at the discretion of the chair. Again, the text of the amendment and intent to vote on it will be included in the notice for the next meeting.

### Section 2 Super-majority rule for passing amendments

A two-thirds ( 2⁄3 ) super-majority vote of the members is required for the amendment to pass. The membership will be notified of the amendment and a new copy of the Constitution and Bylaws posted whenever an amendment is
made.


## Item VIII MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

### Section 1 Rules; Construction of language

In any business meeting conducted by TCDSA, where neither these bylaws nor the DSA National bylaws dictate parliamentary procedure, Robert’s Rules of Order (most current edition) will be the prevailing rules of procedure. Members are expected to familiarize themselves with these rules. If there is any conflict between these bylaws and Minnesota state law governing nonprofit organizations, the state law will prevail.

### Section 2 Fiscal Year; Accounting

The fiscal year for TCDSA will run from October 1 to September 30. In producing financial reports and budgets, TCDSA will use accounting principles generally accepted for small nonprofit organizations.

### Section 3 External relationships

Electoral work TCDSA will work in community with organizations that share, at least in part, our vision and principles. This can include socialist or communist organizations under the discipline of democratic centralism, or liberal advocacy organizations that we may disagree with on other issues. Such associations must be understood to be free and mutual on both sides and not to create any obligations or restrictions. In electoral work, it is important to stress to associated groups that TCDSA, like its parent organization, is not a political party. If TCDSA gives an “endorsement” to a cause or candidate, it must be understood to be informal and informational only. TCDSA may not endorse candidates in partisan races, only those in nonpartisan races, which are usually local races.

### Section 4 Prohibited Activity

TCDSA shall not engage in activity prohibited by the IRS guidelines established for 501(c)4 organizations or similar rules established by the state of Minnesota. Nor shall TCDSA engage in any activity prohibited by resolutions adopted by DSA’s National Convention or DSA’s National Political Committee.

### Section 5 Accessibility and Class Consciousness

TCDSA shall strive to make all of its meetings, forums, and actions accessible and safe spaces for all. This consideration will extend to such things as the accessibility and safety of the venue, the type of food offered, accommodations for differences in sight, hearing, mobility and stamina, child care offerings, the avoidance of high cost venues that will essentially exclude some members, and religious andother identity considerations. Socialism is historically built on class consciousness, specifically on lifting up the working class. TCDSA will take care not to subtly exclude or censor working class viewpoints or viewpoints of any traditionally dis-empowered group.

### Section 6 Conflicts of Interest

If any action taken by the Steering Committee or TCDSA under the governance of the Steering Committee may potentially benefit materially a member of the Steering Committee, that member is said to have a conflict of interest, and will recuse themselves from voting on that action.

### Section 7 Arbitration or Mediation

If a conflict should arise within TCDSA between any member or entity and another member or entity that threatens to harm TCDSA or prevent it from accomplishing its aims, the Steering Committee is empowered to first attempt mediation between the parties. If the Steering Committee itself is one of the entities involved, or if it fails to mediate the conflict, it shall seek the services of an independent mediator to resolve the conflict.

### Section 8 Ratification of this Constitution and these bylaws This Constitution and these

Bylaws shall be submitted to the membership for ratification at the first Annual Membership Convention of TCDSA to be held in September, 2016.
